## Summary of Application
Have accomplished the below:
- Implemented the stated functional requirement.
- Added Unit Tests and Code Coverage
- Custom Metric to monitor performance
- Containerized the Application
- Continous Integration using GitHub Actions
- Few Automated UI Tests using Playwright (Will autocapture the screenshots of the testing)
N.B: Please refer to the attachment [Additonal_Notes](Additonal_Notes.pdf) for more details.


The application can further be enhanced using the following:
- Data Driven End to End Tests including the UI using Selenium/Cypress 
- Make use of Server-Side Pagination so that we don't hit the memory limits when the number of search results is huge.
- Use the API First Approach, write the OpenAPI Spec and generate code
- Use SPA like React/Angular instead of JSP for the View and have APIs as source of data.
